      <p style="color: bisque; font-family: fantasy;font-size: large;"> I am <strong>Miss.Yuwetha Srithathaathirreyanesan</strong> .You can call me <strong>Ms.Yoona</strong> </p>
      <p style="color: bisque; font-family: fantasy;font-size: large;">I am a Freelancer Graphic Designer. I can do any kind of <strong> Graphic Designing works</strong>  and <strong>Web Developement works</strong>.</p>
      <p style="color: bisque; font-family: fantasy;font-size: large;">"Life of a freelancer is very stressfull" - You always hear these kind of words from freelancers but I refuse this status.
          Life of a Designer who creates the world so colourful and joyful with their own creativity is must be a cool person. 
          <br>Am I right?
      </p>
      <h1 style="color: bisque; font-family: fantasy;font-size: large;"class="blog">I believe in loving what I do & helping others do the same.</h1>
        <h4 style="color: bisque; font-family: fantasy;font-size: large;"class="blog">Here on my blog</h4> 
        <p style="color: bisque; font-family: fantasy;font-size: large;"class="blog">I Take my own experiences as a freelance graphic designer and share them with you, 
        hoping to help inspire and motivate you to do what you love and build an epic career around it!</p>
      <p style="color: bisque; font-family: fantasy;font-size: large;"class="first">Today, let's go back in time to the very first t-shirt I ever designed. And what projects 
        I took on that have led me to having a whole career built around designing merchandise for the cloth design industry. 
        Those days were very enjoyable days.I was so excited and waiting for my first order but ofcourse it took too much time 
        too rech me.I felt little sad but I have hope.I was tried a lot for reach more clients.
        <br>One day one of my good friend give me an order for designing a T-Shirt. yeahh........ finally I got it. It is very happy 
        day in my life.After that project I got some other projects.
        finally My bussiness take off and run successfully.</p>
      <p style="color: bisque; font-family: fantasy;font-size: large;">when I designed my very first t-shirt. At this time, I was only proficient in Photoshop. 
        I didn't like Illustrator, because I didn't know how to use it.
        But I knew, Illustrator was fantastic for designing logos, vector graphics, and t-shirts.
        <br><br>I started doing a bunch of online tutorials, and this design was how I taught myself how to use the Pen Tool in Illustrator.
        This was just for fun and an experiment to see what it was like to have my design printed onto a t-shirt.
        <br>Getting to hold my own designs tangibly in my hands, was an experience I've never had before with my work. I made something 
        digitally on the computer, then brought it to life into the real world.
        At this time, I was freelancing, but was taking on any type of design work I could possibly land. 
        But after this design, I knew I wanted to do more t-shirt design projects.

      <h1 style="color: bisque; font-family: fantasy;font-size: large;"class="blog">How I Manage Client Projects And Tasks..</h1>
      <h2>01.DISCOVERY</h2>
      <p style="color: bisque; font-family: fantasy;font-size: large;">The first step after you get in touch is coming together to understand your needs, 
      brainstorm possible directions for your ideal design(s), and create a strategy to make it happen.
      I'm always stoked to hear about a new project, but to make sure we're a good fit, I take each inquiry 
      into careful consideration: How passionate are you about the project? Do you have an understanding of 
      your own goals? Do you show an interest in working with me specifically?
      Once we're on the same page and you're cool with the cost and deadline for your designs, I'll send you 
      an invoice for the initial deposit to lock in your project. Once that's paid, I'm ready to get started 
      on your project and move on to the next phase.</p>
    
    <h2>02.CREATIVE</h2>
    <p style="color: bisque; font-family: fantasy;font-size: large;">
      Here's where the fun starts and ideas are brought to life! In this stage I familiarize myself with your work and take a deeper look into your target audience so that I can create merch that represents you, your message and your fans to a tee.
      I explore ideas and create concepts by sketching, tweaking type, and designing graphics that will best achieve your goals.
      As with any relationship, communication is key, so I'm just an email away and always here for questions as the creation process gets going and we move into the next phase.
   
    <h2>03.FEEDBACK</h2>
    <p style="color: bisque; font-family: fantasy;font-size: large;">
      Once your design(s) are created, I’ll generate the most realistic version of what your merch will look like. 
      I’ll share my decisions behind each design, and ask for your honest feedback.
      You know your brand and your audience best, so your opinion is music to my ears. Through collaborative feedback, 
      together we will work towards a final design or designs.
    </p>
    <h2>04.APPROVAL</h2>
    <p style="color: bisque; font-family: fantasy;font-size: large;">
      When you're stoked with the design and have given me your tick of approval, 
      I'll follow up with a final invoice. Your payment covers the design process and gives you full 
      rights to the artwork to do with whatever you’d like!
      After the approved designs are paid in full, I’ll send all final artwork and files to you directly through email.
    </p>
    <h2>05.EXECUTION</h2>
    <p style="color: bisque; font-family: fantasy;font-size: large;">
       You’re now free to get your merch printed and distributed however you prefer!
       Although I don’t physically produce your merch, I’m always happy to help answer whatever questions you 
       have about making that happen and offer recommendations for my fav printers.
       After the project is completed, I may feature it here on my site or on social media, raving about how 
       rad you are and where people can grab your fresh merch! (I never share designs until you’ve made them 
       public on your end.)
